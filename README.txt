1. Implement the A* search algorithm for the Romania map route-finding problem to find the shortest path between Zerind and Bucharest. Use straight distance as the heuristic function. Answer the following questions:
a) What route was discovered?
b) How many nodes were expanded?
c) What is the cost of this solution?
2. Same problem as in 1. with a new evaluation function f¡¯ = (1-w)g + wh, where w = 0.25 and w = 0.75.


Submission: 

Implement heuristic searching on the Romania Map by three different heuristic:

 * 1) straight distance
 * 2) f = (1 - w)g + wh, where w = 0.25
 * 3) f = (1 - w)g + wh, where w = 0.75

 * Where g() function is the path length from the source, h() function is the direct distance to the destination.
